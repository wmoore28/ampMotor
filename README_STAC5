README_STAC5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is targeted toward precautions when using the STAC5.  More details are
in the db files, etc.  

Power Loss/Reboot
    * There is still a bit of a hiccup in power loss situations.  The STAC5, 
      like most other controllers, always starts up with a 0 step count.  On the
      TODO list is to impliment a monitoring sequencer to track for COMM lost 
      and a 0 step count.  A record position could then be pushed to the 
      controller using set position (SP).  This is likely to be a quite qwerky 
      and I haven't had time to start on it.

Alarm Code
    * The alarm code on the STAC5 latches in between moves.  So be careful where
      you display this information.
    
    * Don't be surprised if Over Temp, Over Voltage, Under Voltage, Over 
      Current, Open Motor Winding, and Bad Encoder are faulted after certain 
      conditions.  It seems to be it's normal response to things like requesting
      a move while the motor is disabled.  Almost like what some call a P1 
      fault.
      
Seek Home/Feed to Sensor
    * DO NOT take this commands lightly.  
    
    * Seek home should only be used if CW, CCW, and Home switches are present.  
      Otherwise, bad things can happen.
      
    * Feed to Sensor can be used for Homing if only CW and CCW switches are 
      available, but use caution when configuring.
      
    * See manual and DB file for more details on usage.
